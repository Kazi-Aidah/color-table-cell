# Color Table Cells
A simple plugin that lets you color table cells in Obsidian. 
Supports both manual coloring and automatic rules based on text or numbers.

By default, table cell colors only show in **Reading Mode**.
But you can also enable them in **Live Preview Mode** if you want.

### How to Color Table Cells

First, switch to **Reading Mode**.

Then **right-click** the cell you want to color and pick a background or text color.

### Setting Rules for Table Coloring

You can set up rules to color cells automatically.
For example:

* If a cell **contains a keyword**, it gets a specific color.
* If a cell **has a number** thatâ€™s greater, smaller, or equal to a set value, it will color itself based on your rule.

### How Single Cell Coloring Works

When you pick a color for a cell, the plugin saves it to a small data file.  
It keeps track of the file name, table, row, and column, so when you reopen the note, it knows exactly which cell to recolor.


#### Example `data.json`

```json
{
  "settings": { ... },
  "cellData": {
    "Notes/Math.md": {
      "table_0": {
        "row_1": {
          "col_2": {
            "bg": "#FF9494",
            "color": "#000000"
          }
        }
      }
    }
  }
}
```

The Data basically tells Obsidian that in `Notes/Math.md`, 
the first table (`table_0`) has a cell at row 1, column 2 with:
- Background: `#FF9494`
- Text color: `#000000`

**In short:**  
Each colored cell is stored by its file, table, row, and column in `data.json`.  
When you open the note, the plugin finds them and restores the colors automatically.

### Does it work on Mobile Obsidian?
Yes! The colors show up on mobile too.
**However, there are a few issues for now:**
- The Single Cell Colours don't get added or appear on mobile, but Rule Colouring works fine.
  (I will try to fix this.)
